${string%%substring}
filename="bash.string.txt"

echo "After deletion of longest match from front:" ${filename##*.}
echo "After deletion of longest match from back:" ${filename%%.*}

$ ./longest.sh
After deletion of longest match from front: txt
After deletion of longest match from back: bash
5. Find and Replace String Values inside Bash Shell Script
Replace only first match ${string/pattern/replacement}
Replace all the matches  ${string//pattern/replacement}
Replace beginning and end ${string/#pattern/replacement}

${string/%pattern/replacement}

#! /bin/bash

filename="/root/admin/monitoring/process.sh"

echo "Replaced at the beginning:" ${filename/#\/root/\/tmp}
echo "Replaced at the end": ${filename/%.*/.ksh}

$ ./posmatch.sh
Replaced at the beginning: /tmp/admin/monitoring/process.sh
